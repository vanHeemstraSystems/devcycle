## Microservice Architectures: A Modular Approach to Building Complex AI Systems

As artificial intelligence (AI) systems grow in complexity, traditional monolithic architectures can become unwieldy, hindering development speed and flexibility. Microservice architectures offer a compelling alternative by breaking down these complex systems into smaller, independent services. Each microservice focuses on a specific function and communicates with others through well-defined APIs.
